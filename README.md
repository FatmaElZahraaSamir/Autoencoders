# Image Super Resolution Using Autoencoders in Keras

Design and build an autoencoder neural network to create high-resolution images from low-resolution source images.

- Build the Encoder
- Build the Decoder to Complete the Network
- Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine
- Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model
- Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results
